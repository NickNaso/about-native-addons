### Running

To generate the above data, run:

```
npm i
mkdir cache

# Collect packages from npm (takes 90 minutes or so)
node bin/collect-npm-data > cache/candidates.ndjson

cat cache/candidates.ndjson | node bin/process-npm-data
```

## Overlapping Symbols

This section is about finding addons affected by overlapping global symbols on mac (and some unixes reportedly). When an addon has global symbols it can conflict with other addons (or other versions) loaded into the same process, leading to addons calling into each other and bugs that are hard to debug (and discover).

This issue can be fixed by compiling the addon with `-fvisibility=hidden`. See [nodejs/node-gyp#1891](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/1891). Add the following condition to your `binding.gyp`:

```python
{
  "targets": [{
    "target_name": "my_native_addon",
    "conditions": [
      ["OS == 'mac'", {
         "cflags+": ["-fvisibility=hidden"],
         "xcode_settings": {
           "GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN": "YES" # -fvisibility=hidden
         }
      }]
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Overview

This lists from left to right: **name**, **version**, which mechanism it uses to ship prebuilds (those with `node-gyp-build` ship prebuilds inside the npm package, those with `prebuild-install` have a download step), the amount of **prebuilds** (for distinct targets), whether it uses **N-API**, how many global **symbols** the mac prebuild(s) have, whether the addon could be **loaded** with `process.dlopen()` and lastly if any of the global symbol names overlap (potentially **conflict**) with other addons in the list (has false positives).

| Name           | Version      | Type             | Prebuilds | N-API | Syms | Load | Conflict |

### Package tests

This is the result of running tests (usually `npm t`) of a project, after having injected another addon into the process. Note that for tests to fail, the following conditions must be met:

1. The project has good coverage
2. The mac build has global symbols
3. The names of those symbols overlap with the other addon
4. Those overlapping symbols don't point to similar code.
